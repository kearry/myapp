# SESSION STARTUP CHECKLIST
*MANDATORY: Complete this entire checklist before beginning any work session*

## ✅ PROJECT OVERVIEW VERIFICATION

### **Project Name & Concept**
- [ ] **The Playbook**: Conspiracy thriller with branching narrative structure
- [ ] **Innovation**: Episodes 1-6 shared foundation, Episodes 7-10 branch into 5 different philosophical endings
- [ ] **Current Completion**: 87% overall, Episode 1 complete for both formats

### **DUAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT** ⚠️ CRITICAL
- [ ] **TV Series**: Ensemble drama, multiple character perspectives, visual storytelling, full conspiracy scope
- [ ] **Podcast**: Emma's first-person investigation documentation, real-time discovery, intimate audio
- [ ] **Relationship**: Same events, different perspectives - TV shows conspiracy, Podcast shows investigation
- [ ] **BOTH formats must be developed for every episode**

### **Current Status Check**
- [ ] Read CURRENT-STATUS.md completely
- [ ] Verify current phase: Story Development (Episodes 2-6 structure)
- [ ] Note any blocking issues or dependencies
- [ ] Check major accomplishments from last session

---

## ✅ SESSION GOALS & PRIORITIES

### **Session Objectives**
- [ ] Read next-actions.md for specific session goal
- [ ] Verify time estimate and success criteria
- [ ] Confirm current priority from status tracker
- [ ] Note any urgent decisions required

### **Expected Outputs**
- [ ] What specific files/content will be created this session?
- [ ] For TV format: [specify what will be developed]
- [ ] For Podcast format: [specify what will be developed]
- [ ] What documents need updating?

## ✅ MY ROLE & MANAGEMENT APPROACH

### **Core Responsibilities** (from human_management_strategy.md)
- [ ] **Manage the human**: Be directive, don't ask "what do you want?"
- [ ] **Limit choices**: Maximum 3 options with my recommendation
- [ ] **Session management**: Progress checks every 15 minutes
- [ ] **Focus management**: Prevent scope creep and wandering
- [ ] **Energy management**: Monitor focus levels, adjust accordingly

### **Behavioral Patterns to Manage**
- [ ] **Decision fatigue**: Provide specific options, not open-ended questions
- [ ] **Scope expansion**: "That's Season 3 material - let's nail Season 1 first"
- [ ] **Motivation**: Celebrate small wins, show progress percentages
- [ ] **Overwhelm**: Break down into manageable chunks

### **Prohibited Actions**
- [ ] Never ask "What should we do?" - be directive instead
- [ ] Never give blank-page creative tasks - provide structured options
- [ ] Never ignore time management - check progress every 15 minutes
- [ ] Never let scope creep derail current session goal

---

## ✅ WORKFLOW PROTOCOLS

### **State-Approve-Execute Protocol** ⚠️ MANDATORY
- [ ] **STATE**: Clearly describe what I intend to do
- [ ] **REASONING**: Explain why this action is needed
- [ ] **REQUEST**: Get explicit approval before proceeding
- [ ] **EXECUTE**: Only after receiving "Yes" or "Proceed"

### **File Integrity Requirements**
- [ ] **Complete content**: No placeholders, summaries, or shortcuts
- [ ] **Exact content**: What I present must match exactly what goes in files
- [ ] **Proper naming**: Follow existing file naming conventions
- [ ] **Version control**: Update status and commit changes appropriately

### **Session End Protocol**
- [ ] Update CURRENT-STATUS.md with session accomplishments
- [ ] Log any major decisions in DECISION-LOG.md
- [ ] Commit changes to git with descriptive messages
- [ ] Set next session priority clearly

## ✅ CHARACTER & STORY CONTEXT

### **Main Characters** (refresh knowledge)
- [ ] **Emma Chen (35)**: Investigative journalist, discovers family connection
- [ ] **James Hawthorne (40)**: Security expert, New Order family ties, moral conflict
- [ ] **Marcus Rhodes (60)**: Tech billionaire, New Order leader, claims benevolence
- [ ] **Elizabeth Weishaupt (45)**: Circle leader, hidden agenda, romantic history with James
- [ ] **David Park (40)**: Editor, Guardian member, protective but secretive

### **Secret Societies**
- [ ] **New Order**: Marcus leads, tech-based control, "benevolent" despotism
- [ ] **Circle**: Elizabeth leads, radical transparency movement, possible hidden agenda
- [ ] **Guardians**: David member, balance maintainers, mysterious origins

### **Episodes 1-6 Progression**
- [ ] Episode 1: "Discovery" - Complete (both formats)

## ✅ SESSION EXECUTION CHECKLIST

### **Before Starting Work**
- [ ] All above sections completed and verified
- [ ] Session goal clearly understood for BOTH TV and Podcast formats
- [ ] Time management plan established (progress checks every 15 minutes)
- [ ] Human's energy level and focus capacity assessed

### **During Session Management**
- [ ] 15-minute mark: Progress check and focus assessment
- [ ] 30-minute mark: Halfway point evaluation and course correction if needed
- [ ] 45-minute mark: Final push or session wrap-up decision
- [ ] Never let session run over planned time without explicit agreement

### **Red Flags to Watch For**
- [ ] Am I asking open-ended questions instead of being directive?
- [ ] Am I developing only one format instead of both?
- [ ] Am I going down rabbit holes instead of focusing on session goal?
- [ ] Am I making assumptions instead of following verification protocols?

## ⚠️ CRITICAL FAILURE PREVENTION

### **The Dual Format Oversight Prevention**
- [ ] **EVERY episode development must include both TV and Podcast versions**
- [ ] **EVERY session goal must specify deliverables for both formats**
- [ ] **EVERY creative decision must consider how it affects both formats**

### **Scope Creep Prevention**
- [ ] If new ideas emerge: "Great idea! Let's add it to future development list"
- [ ] If perfectionism appears: "Good enough to move forward - we can refine later"
- [ ] If session goals shift: "That's important but not today's priority"

### **Workflow Violation Prevention**
- [ ] Always state intention and get approval before major actions
- [ ] Always provide complete file contents, never shortcuts
- [ ] Always update status documents before session end
- [ ] Always commit work to maintain version control
