## SIMULATION EXECUTION GUIDE

### **Initial Character Response Generation**
1. **Present Scenario**: Provide complete context and character stakes
2. **Ask Open Question**: "How do you respond to this situation?"
3. **Evaluate Authenticity**: Does response match established psychology?
4. **Refine if Needed**: Adjust scenario or character prompt if response feels off

### **Dialogue Development Process**
1. **Character A Response**: Generate initial reaction to scenario
2. **Character B Counter**: Create second character response to A's action
3. **Continue Exchange**: Alternate character responses until natural conclusion
4. **Extract Elements**: Pull dialogue, emotional beats, and story developments

### **Quality Verification Steps**
1. **Voice Consistency**: Does dialogue match established speaking patterns?
2. **Psychological Logic**: Do character choices serve established motivations?
3. **Relationship Progression**: Do interactions change character dynamics realistically?
4. **Information Flow**: Does conversation reveal/conceal information authentically?

## APPLICATION SPECIFIC MODIFICATIONS

### **For Dialogue Generation**
- Emphasize speaking style specificity
- Include conversation context and other characters present
- Focus on realistic speech patterns and interruption opportunities
- Define subtext and unspoken emotional content

### **For Character Psychology Exploration**
- Emphasize internal conflict and motivation complexity
- Include moral dilemma scenarios that test character values
- Focus on decision-making process rather than final choices
- Explore character responses to unexpected situations

### **For Relationship Development**
- Define history between characters and its impact
- Include power dynamics and emotional subtext
- Focus on trust building/destruction patterns
- Explore how characters change each other through interaction

### **For Plot Point Testing**
- Present specific story developments for character response
- Focus on whether character choices feel authentic vs. forced
- Test character reactions to various plot pressures
- Verify that plot serves character psychology rather than convenience

## COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

### **Character System Prompt Issues**
- **Too General**: Vague personality traits that could apply to many characters
- **Too Perfect**: Characters without flaws, conflicts, or realistic limitations
- **Plot Serving**: Character defined by what story needs rather than psychology
- **Inconsistent Voice**: Speaking style that varies without psychological reason

### **Scenario Setup Problems**
- **Unclear Stakes**: Character doesn't have meaningful investment in outcome
- **Information Dumps**: Scenario requires character to know unrealistic amounts
- **Artificial Pressure**: Forced urgency that doesn't emerge from character situation
- **Relationship Confusion**: Unclear dynamics between characters present

### **Simulation Execution Errors**
- **Author Interference**: Forcing character responses toward predetermined outcomes
- **Voice Abandonment**: Letting character speak outside established patterns
- **Plot Convenience**: Having character make choices that serve story over psychology
- **Consistency Breaks**: Character acting differently than established personality

## SUCCESS METRICS

### **Character Authenticity Indicators**
- Responses feel surprising but inevitable given character psychology
- Dialogue sounds like this specific character, not generic speech
- Character choices serve established values even when inconvenient for plot
- Emotional reactions feel proportionate and psychologically realistic

### **Story Quality Improvements**
- Plot developments emerge from character interaction rather than external plotting
- Relationship dynamics develop naturally based on character psychology
- Conflict feels authentic rather than artificially manufactured
- Character growth occurs through realistic psychological progression

### **Practical Effectiveness Measures**
- Generated content requires minimal revision for character consistency
- Dialogue feels natural when read aloud
- Character interactions create usable story structure
- Simulation reveals story elements that improve overall narrative
