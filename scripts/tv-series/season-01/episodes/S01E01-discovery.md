## SCRIPT

### TEASER

**FADE IN:**

**EXT. SEATTLE TECH CAMPUS - DAWN**

Glass and steel towers reflect the sunrise. Modern, sterile, powerful. Security cameras track movement on empty walkways.

**TITLE CARD: "SEATTLE - PRESENT DAY"**

**INT. TECH CAMPUS - SERVER ROOM - CONTINUOUS**

Humming servers, blinking lights. TYLER (20s) works late, eyes bloodshot. He opens a terminal, starts typing code.

**TYLER**  
(muttering)  
Come on... just need to trace this subroutine...

His screen fills with scrolling code. Something catches his eye. He highlights a section, frowns.

**TYLER (CONT'D)**  
What the hell?

The code resolves into readable text: "Social compliance algorithms require 73% consensus threshold before implementation..."

Tyler's eyes widen. He screenshots frantically.

**TYLER (CONT'D)**  
(whispered)  
Jesus Christ.

FOOTSTEPS echo in the hallway. Tyler quickly closes windows, grabs his phone. The door opens as he hits send on an email.

**SECURITY GUARD**  
Working late again, Tyler?

**TYLER**  
(nervous)  
Just... just finishing up.

The Guard's radio crackles. We don't hear the words, but his expression changes.

**SECURITY GUARD**  
I'm gonna need you to come with me.

**CUT TO BLACK.**

### ACT ONE

**INT. EMMA'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING**

EMMA CHEN (35) jolts awake to her phone buzzing. Spartan apartment, law school debt notices on the counter, empty ramen containers. The life of an underpaid journalist.

She checks her email. New message from "CONCERNED CITIZEN" with attachment.

**EMMA**  
(reading subject line)  
"They're watching everything we do."

She almost deletes it, then notices the sender used an encrypted service. Opens the attachment - screenshot of code.

Her expression shifts from annoyance to interest.

**EMMA (CONT'D)**  
(to herself)  
What are you?

**INT. PACIFIC NORTHWEST HERALD - NEWSROOM - DAY**

Bustling newsroom. Emma enters carrying coffee and her laptop. Colleagues barely look up - everyone's buried in their screens.

DAVID PARK (40), Emma's editor, approaches. Measured, careful, but genuinely seems to care about Emma's work.

**DAVID**  
Chen. Got that piece on tech worker housing ready?

**EMMA**  
Almost. David, hypothetical question - if someone sent you code that looked like... surveillance instructions, what would you do?

**DAVID**  
(pause)  
Depends. Is this someone credible?

**EMMA**  
Anonymous tip. But the code... it's sophisticated. Technical.

**DAVID**  
(carefully)  
Emma, we've talked about conspiracy theories. Your readers need housing stories, not-

**EMMA**  
It's not a conspiracy theory if it's real.

David studies her for a long moment. Something shifts in his expression - recognition, then concern.

**DAVID**  
(too specific)  
Show me what you have. But quietly. And Emma... who else knows about this code?

**EMMA**  
(surprised by the question)  
Just us. Why?

**DAVID**  
(pause, then deflecting)  
No reason. Just... be careful who you trust with this.

**INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS**

David closes the door behind them. Emma opens her laptop, shows him the screenshots.

**DAVID**  
(reading)  
"Social compliance algorithms..." Where did you get this?

**EMMA**  
Anonymous source. Dead drop style.

David's expression changes. He recognizes something.

**DAVID**  
Emma, this is... this could be legitimate surveillance infrastructure.

**EMMA**  
That's what I thought. So what do I do?

**DAVID**  
(carefully weighing words)  
Research it. Quietly. Don't publish anything until we can verify sources.

**EMMA**  
David, you're acting like you've seen this before.

**DAVID**  
(long pause)  
Twenty-four hours, Emma. Give me twenty-four hours to make some calls.

**EXT. SEATTLE STREETS - DAY**

Emma walks through downtown, mind racing. She pulls out her phone, starts researching the metadata from the code screenshots.

**EMMA (V.O.)**  
Red Tree Technologies. Data analytics company. Government contracts.

She finds their corporate website. Clean, professional, vague about their actual services.

Her phone buzzes. News alert: "Local Tech Worker Dies in Highway Accident."

Emma's heart stops. She clicks the link.

**EMMA (V.O.) (CONT'D)**  
Tyler Davidson, 28, data analyst at Red Tree Technologies...

The same company from the code metadata.

**EMMA**  
(whispered)  
No way.

---

### ACT TWO

**INT. EMMA'S APARTMENT - DAY**

Emma frantically researches Tyler on her laptop. His LinkedIn profile is still up: "Data Analyst at Red Tree Technologies. Passionate about ethical technology."

His last post, three days ago: "Some truths are worth the risk."

Her phone rings. Unknown number.

**EMMA**  
Hello?

**ELIZABETH (V.O.)**  
(calm, professional)  
Ms. Chen? You received something that wasn't meant for you.

**EMMA**  
Who is this?

**ELIZABETH (V.O.)**  
Someone who can help. But first, you need to understand what you're really looking at.

**EMMA**  
The person who sent this is dead.

**ELIZABETH (V.O.)**  
Tyler was eliminated because he discovered something that threatens a system that's been in place for centuries.

Emma sits down hard.

**EMMA**  
How do you know about Tyler?

**ELIZABETH (V.O.)**  
Meet me at Pike Place Market in one hour. The fish vendors. Come alone.

**EMMA**  
Why should I trust you?

**ELIZABETH (V.O.)**  
Because your family wasn't randomly targeted in 2008, Emma. Your father was asking the same questions Tyler was asking.

The line goes dead.

**EXT. PIKE PLACE MARKET - DAY**

Emma waits nervously by the fish market. ELIZABETH WEISHAUPT (45) approaches - well-dressed, confident, carrying a manila envelope.

**ELIZABETH**  
Emma Chen?

**EMMA**  
You called me.

**ELIZABETH**  
My name is Elizabeth Weishaupt. That name should mean something to you.

She hands Emma the envelope.

**ELIZABETH (CONT'D)**  
Open it.

Emma opens the envelope. Inside: charts, documents, analysis in her father's handwriting.

**EMMA**  
How did you get my father's research?

**ELIZABETH**  
He contacted us before he died. He'd figured out that the 2008 crash wasn't random market forces - it was systematically engineered to destroy specific communities.

Emma flips through the documents, hands shaking.

**ELIZABETH (CONT'D)**  
But that's just the surface. The surveillance system Tyler discovered, the financial manipulation your father uncovered - it's all part of something much older.

Elizabeth pulls out photocopies of historical documents. The paper looks aged, the text handwritten in archaic script.

**ELIZABETH (CONT'D)**  
1776. The original playbook. The same families, the same methods, just updated for each era.

**EMMA**  
This is conspiracy theory nonsense.

**ELIZABETH**  
Is it? Your father is dead. Tyler is dead. How many more before you take this seriously?

Suddenly, black SUVs pull up at both ends of the market. Elizabeth grabs Emma's arm.

**ELIZABETH (CONT'D)**  
We need to go. Now.

They push through the crowd. Elizabeth presses a business card into Emma's hand.

**ELIZABETH (CONT'D)**  
Research the name Weishaupt. Be very careful who you trust.

Elizabeth disappears into the crowd. Emma escapes through a different exit.

### ACT THREE

**INT. EMMA'S CAR - MOVING - DAY**

Emma drives aimlessly, the documents scattered on her passenger seat. Her hands shake as she grips the steering wheel.

Her phone rings.

**MARCUS RHODES (V.O.)**  
(calm, paternal)  
Ms. Chen, my name is Marcus Rhodes. I think it's time we talked.

**EMMA**  
How did you get this number?

**MARCUS RHODES (V.O.)**  
I'm the person Elizabeth has been trying to expose. I'd like to offer you a different perspective on the story you're developing.

**EMMA**  
You killed Tyler.

**MARCUS RHODES (V.O.)**  
Tyler died because he stole classified information that could destabilize systems protecting millions of people.

Emma pulls over, heart pounding.

**MARCUS RHODES (V.O.) (CONT'D)**  
Your father died because he couldn't accept that some truths are too dangerous for public consumption.

**EMMA**  
My father died of a heart attack.

**MARCUS RHODES (V.O.)**  
Your father was murdered, Ms. Chen. But not by us.

**EMMA**  
What do you mean?

**MARCUS RHODES (V.O.)**  
Elizabeth Weishaupt isn't fighting for transparency. Her family has been trying to replace our system with something far worse for over two centuries.

**EMMA**  
I don't believe you.

**MARCUS RHODES (V.O.)**  
Coffee tomorrow. 10 AM. Victrola on Capitol Hill. I'll explain why your father had to die, and why Elizabeth's "truth" will get millions killed.

The line goes dead.

**INT. EMMA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT**

Emma sits on her floor, documents spread in a wide circle around her. Modern surveillance code, her father's 2008 financial analysis, 18th-century historical papers.

She opens her laptop and starts typing.

**EMMA (V.O.)**  
(typing)  
"The Playbook: An Investigation into Systematic Social Control."

She looks at Tyler's LinkedIn photo on her screen, his last post: "Some truths are worth the risk."

Her phone buzzes. Text from Elizabeth: "Meeting tomorrow. I'll explain everything about your father."

Another text from an unknown number: "Join us willingly, or be eliminated. Your choice."

Emma stares at both messages, then at the historical documents surrounding her.

**EMMA**  
(to herself)  
What have I gotten myself into?

She closes her laptop, but doesn't turn off the lights.

**FADE TO BLACK.**

**END OF EPISODE**
