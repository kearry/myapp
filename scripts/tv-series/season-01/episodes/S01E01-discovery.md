## SCRIPT

### TEASER

**FADE IN:**

**EXT. SEATTLE TECH CAMPUS - DAWN**

Glass and steel towers reflect the sunrise. Modern, sterile, powerful. Security cameras track movement on empty walkways.

**TITLE CARD: "SEATTLE - PRESENT DAY"**

**INT. TECH CAMPUS - SERVER ROOM - CONTINUOUS**

Humming servers, blinking lights. A TECHNICIAN (20s) works late, eyes bloodshot. He opens a terminal, starts typing code.

**TYLER**  
(muttering)  
Come on... just need to trace this subroutine...

His screen fills with scrolling code. Something catches his eye. He highlights a section, frowns.

**TYLER (CONT'D)**  
What the hell?

The code resolves into readable text: "Social compliance algorithms require 73% consensus threshold before implementation..."

Tyler's eyes widen. He screenshots frantically.

**TYLER (CONT'D)**  
(whispered)  
Jesus Christ.

FOOTSTEPS echo in the hallway. Tyler quickly closes windows, grabs his phone. The door opens as he hits send on an email.

**SECURITY GUARD**  
Working late again, Tyler?

**TYLER**  
(nervous)  
Just... just finishing up.

The Guard's radio crackles. We don't hear the words, but his expression changes.

**SECURITY GUARD**  
I'm gonna need you to come with me.

**CUT TO BLACK.**

### ACT ONE

**INT. EMMA'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING**

EMMA CHEN (35) jolts awake to her phone buzzing. Spartan apartment, law school debt notices on the counter, empty ramen containers. The life of an underpaid journalist.

She checks her email. New message from "CONCERNED CITIZEN" with attachment.

**EMMA**  
(reading subject line)  
"They're watching everything we do."

She almost deletes it, then notices the sender used an encrypted service. Opens the attachment - screenshot of code.

Her expression shifts from annoyance to interest.

**EMMA (CONT'D)**  
(to herself)  
What are you?

**INT. PACIFIC NORTHWEST HERALD - NEWSROOM - DAY**

Bustling newsroom. Emma enters carrying coffee and her laptop. Colleagues barely look up - everyone's buried in their screens.

DAVID PARK (40), Emma's editor, approaches. Measured, careful, but genuinely seems to care about Emma's work.

**DAVID**  
Chen. Got that piece on tech worker housing ready?

**EMMA**  
Almost. David, hypothetical question - if someone sent you code that looked like... surveillance instructions, what would you do?

**DAVID**  
(pause)  
Depends. Is this someone credible?

**EMMA**  
Anonymous tip. But the code... it's sophisticated. Technical.

**DAVID**  
(carefully)  
Emma, we've talked about conspiracy theories. Your readers need housing stories, not-

**EMMA**  
It's not a conspiracy theory if it's real.

David studies her for a long moment. Something shifts in his expression - recognition, then concern.

**DAVID**  
(too specific)  
Show me what you have. But quietly. And Emma... who else knows about this code?

**EMMA**  
(surprised by the question)  
Just us. Why?

**DAVID**  
(pause, then deflecting)  
No reason. Just... be careful who you trust with this.
