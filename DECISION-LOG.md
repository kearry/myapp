# The Playbook - Decision Log

## Major Project Decisions

### 2025-06-06: Format Strategy - Parallel Stories
**Decision**: Option A - Parallel Stories approach for TV and Podcast development
**Context**: TV and podcast are fundamentally different mediums requiring different storytelling approaches
**Strategy Chosen**:
- **TV Series**: Traditional ensemble drama with multiple character perspectives, visual storytelling, full conspiracy scope
- **Podcast**: Emma's personal investigation documentation - first-person, real-time discovery, intimate audio experience
- **Relationship**: Same events, different perspectives - TV shows the conspiracy, Podcast shows the investigation
**Rationale**: 
- Maximizes each format's unique strengths
- Creates complementary viewing/listening experience 
- Most innovative transmedia approach
- Cross-pollination between audiences
**Impact**: Development will focus on TV episode structure first, then adapt Emma's investigation perspective for podcast versions
**Alternative Options Rejected**: Direct adaptation (lacks format optimization), Single format focus (misses transmedia opportunity)

### 2025-06-05: Branching Narrative Structure
**Decision**: All 5 endings via branching narrative - Early Branch approach
**Context**: Series explores different philosophical approaches to power and resistance
**Structure Chosen**: Episodes 1-6 shared foundation, Episodes 7-10 branch into 5 different ending paths
**5 Ending Philosophies**:
- **Hopeful**: Truth wins, democratic transformation
- **Realistic**: Incremental change, ongoing struggle  
- **Dark**: System too powerful, resistance crushed
- **Cyclical**: Power corrupts, new conspiracy emerges
- **Transcendent**: Evolution beyond control/resistance
**Rationale**: Audience choice, innovation, rewatch value, philosophical exploration
**Impact**: 26 total episodes per format (6 shared + 20 branched), industry innovation potential, first-mover advantage
**Alternative Options Rejected**: Single ending (less innovative), Multiple choice points (exponential complexity)

### 2025-06-05: Repository Structure
**Decision**: Dual TV/Podcast development with professional git workflow
**Context**: Complex project requiring organized development and potential collaboration
**Structure**: Separate directories for TV scripts, podcast scripts, documentation, research
**Rationale**: Version control, collaboration ready, professional presentation, scalable development
**Impact**: Clear organization, professional development workflow, ready for team expansion
**Tools**: Git version control, markdown documentation, structured file naming
