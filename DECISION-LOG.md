# The Playbook - Decision Log

## Major Project Decisions

### 2025-06-07: Character Name Standardization - Tyler Fix
**Decision**: Standardize tech worker character name as "Tyler" across all repository files
**Context**: Podcast Episode 1 script (Doc 19) incorrectly used "Marcus Chen" for dead tech worker, creating confusion with Marcus Rhodes (tech billionaire antagonist)
**Files Updated**:
- **Doc 19**: `scripts/podcast/season-01/episodes/S01E01-discovery.md` - Changed "Marcus Chen" to "Tyler" throughout
- **Doc 3**: `scripts/tv-series/season-01/episodes/S01E01-discovery.md` - Verified Tyler usage (was already correct)
- **Audio Elements**: Added Marcus Rhodes to voice casting requirements in Doc 19
**Character Authority Established**:
- **Tyler**: Dead tech worker at Red Tree Technologies (sends surveillance code, dies in car accident)
- **Marcus Rhodes**: Tech billionaire, New Order leader, antagonist (calls Emma, claims father was murdered)
**Rationale**: 
- Eliminates character name confusion between tech worker and antagonist
- Aligns with user's actual transcript which uses "Tyler"
- Maintains Character Authority List consistency
- Enables clear voice casting for podcast production
**Impact**: Episode 1 scripts now production-ready for both TV and Podcast formats with consistent character names
**Alternative Options Rejected**: Keep "Marcus Chen" (causes confusion), Use different name entirely (breaks transcript authenticity)

### 2025-06-07: Character Relationship Gap Fixes
**Decision**: Define missing relationships between society leaders and key characters
**Context**: Character Relations Mind Map revealed critical gaps that would cause story problems in Episodes 2-6
**Relationships Added**:
- **Marcus Rhodes ↔ Elizabeth Weishaupt**: Former allies (early 2000s tech resistance) who split over methodology in 2008 - now strategic enemies with mutual respect
- **Guardians ↔ Other Societies**: Balance maintainers with different intelligence levels on each society - David serves Guardian agenda, not necessarily Emma's interests
- **James Hawthorne ↔ David Park**: Professional rivals competing for Emma's guidance - both protective but for different reasons and loyalties
**Rationale**: 
- Prevents story inconsistencies in Episodes 2-6 development
- Adds depth to society leader dynamics beyond just competing for Emma
- Creates realistic professional tensions between Emma's advisors
- Establishes clear intelligence levels between societies
**Impact**: Episodes 2-6 can now reference Marcus-Elizabeth shared history, show James-David tension, and demonstrate Guardian balance agenda
**Alternative Options Rejected**: Leave gaps unfilled (would cause story problems), Create antagonistic relationships only (lacks complexity)

### 2025-06-06: Format Strategy - Parallel Stories
**Decision**: Option A - Parallel Stories approach for TV and Podcast development
**Context**: TV and podcast are fundamentally different mediums requiring different storytelling approaches
**Strategy Chosen**:
- **TV Series**: Traditional ensemble drama with multiple character perspectives, visual storytelling, full conspiracy scope
- **Podcast**: Emma's personal investigation documentation - first-person, real-time discovery, intimate audio experience
- **Relationship**: Same events, different perspectives - TV shows the conspiracy, Podcast shows the investigation
**Rationale**: 
- Maximizes each format's unique strengths
- Creates complementary viewing/listening experience 
- Most innovative transmedia approach
- Cross-pollination between audiences
**Impact**: Development will focus on TV episode structure first, then adapt Emma's investigation perspective for podcast versions
**Alternative Options Rejected**: Direct adaptation (lacks format optimization), Single format focus (misses transmedia opportunity)

### 2025-06-05: Branching Narrative Structure
**Decision**: All 5 endings via branching narrative - Early Branch approach
**Context**: Series explores different philosophical approaches to power and resistance
**Structure Chosen**: Episodes 1-6 shared foundation, Episodes 7-10 branch into 5 different ending paths
**5 Ending Philosophies**:
- **Hopeful**: Truth wins, democratic transformation
- **Realistic**: Incremental change, ongoing struggle  
- **Dark**: System too powerful, resistance crushed
- **Cyclical**: Power corrupts, new conspiracy emerges
- **Transcendent**: Evolution beyond control/resistance
**Rationale**: Audience choice, innovation, rewatch value, philosophical exploration
**Impact**: 26 total episodes per format (6 shared + 20 branched), industry innovation potential, first-mover advantage
**Alternative Options Rejected**: Single ending (less innovative), Multiple choice points (exponential complexity)

### 2025-06-05: Repository Structure
**Decision**: Dual TV/Podcast development with professional git workflow
**Context**: Complex project requiring organized development and potential collaboration
**Structure**: Separate directories for TV scripts, podcast scripts, documentation, research
**Rationale**: Version control, collaboration ready, professional presentation, scalable development
**Impact**: Clear organization, professional development workflow, ready for team expansion
**Tools**: Git version control, markdown documentation, structured file naming

## Decision Framework
**Criteria for Major Decisions**:
1. **Innovation Potential**: Does this advance storytelling or create competitive advantage?
2. **Execution Feasibility**: Can this be accomplished with available resources?
3. **Audience Value**: Does this enhance the audience experience?
4. **Market Positioning**: Does this differentiate from existing content?
5. **Scalability**: Does this support future development and growth?

## Next Major Decision Required
**Episode 7-10 Ending Philosophy**: After Episodes 2-6 development, must choose which of the 5 philosophical endings to develop first for initial production.
