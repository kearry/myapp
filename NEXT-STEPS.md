# Next Steps for The Playbook Repository

## Immediate Actions (Today)

1. **Content Migration**
   - [ ] Migrate Core Knowledge Base to `docs/series-bible/01-core-knowledge-base.md`
   - [ ] Migrate Character Database to `docs/series-bible/02-character-database.md`
   - [ ] Migrate TV Episode 1 script to `scripts/tv-series/season-01/episodes/S01E01-discovery.md`
   - [ ] Migrate Status Tracker to `docs/project-management/status-tracker.md`

2. **Format Decision**

     - Audio adaptation of TV series
     - Companion investigation podcast
     - Standalone audio drama
     - Documentary-style exploration
     - Hybrid approach

3. **Git Setup**
   - [ ] Create GitHub repository (recommended: private)
   - [ ] Add remote: `git remote add origin [your-repo-url]`
   - [ ] Push main branch: `git push -u origin main`
   - [ ] Push development branch: `git push -u origin development`

## Development Workflow Start

4. **Begin Episode 2 Development**
   ```bash
   git checkout development
   git checkout -b feature/tv-S01E02-revelation
   # Use templates/episode-template.md as starting point
   ```

5. **Begin Podcast Development**
   ```bash
   git checkout development
   git checkout -b feature/podcast-S01E01-discovery
   # Use templates/podcast-episode-template.md as starting point
   ```

6. **Character Arc Development**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/character-arcs-season-1
   # Use templates/character-arc-template.md for each main character
   ```

## Repository Configuration

7. **GitHub Settings** (if using GitHub)
   - [ ] Set repository to private
   - [ ] Enable branch protection for main branch
   - [ ] Enable issues for task tracking
   - [ ] Create project board for development tracking
   - [ ] Set up wiki for additional documentation

8. **Collaboration Setup**
   - [ ] Add collaborators if working with others
   - [ ] Set up review requirements for main branch
   - [ ] Configure automated checks if desired

## Content Development Priority

9. **Critical Decision Needed**
   - [ ] **URGENT**: Decide series ending philosophy
     - Hopeful (truth wins)
     - Realistic (complex outcomes)
     - Dark (system too strong)
     - Cyclical (eternal pattern)
     - Transcendent (evolution beyond)

10. **Season 1 Structure**
    - [ ] Plan 8-10 episode structure for TV series
    - [ ] Plan podcast episode structure (same count or different)
    - [ ] Map character arcs across both formats
    - [ ] Plan major reveals and cliffhangers for both formats

## Podcast Development Strategy

11. **Format Decisions**
    - [ ] **Narrative Style**: 
      - Emma's first-person investigation
      - Documentary-style with narration
      - Audio drama with full character voices
      - Hybrid approach
    
    - [ ] **Relationship to TV Series**:
      - Direct adaptation (same story, audio format)
      - Companion series (additional content/perspective)
      - Standalone version (independent but related)
      - Prequel/sequel content
    
    - [ ] **Episode Structure**:
      - Length (30-45 minutes recommended)
      - Segment breakdown
      - Recurring elements
      - Season arc pacing

12. **Audio Production Planning**
    - [ ] Voice casting considerations
    - [ ] Sound design philosophy
    - [ ] Music style and integration
    - [ ] Recording requirements and setup
    - [ ] Post-production workflow
