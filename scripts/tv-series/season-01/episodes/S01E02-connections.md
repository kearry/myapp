## SCRIPT

### TEASER

**FADE IN:**

**EXT. VICTROLA COFFEE - CAPITOL HILL - MORNING**

Emma sits at a corner table, documents from Elizabeth spread before her. She's early, nervous, constantly checking the door. The coffee shop bustles with tech workers and students.

MARCUS RHODES (60) enters - well-dressed, confident, scanning until he spots Emma. He approaches with two coffee cups.

**MARCUS**  
Emma. Thank you for coming. I know this can't be easy after... everything that's happened.

He sets a latte in front of her.

**MARCUS (CONT'D)**  
I got you a latte—oat milk, right? I remember you mentioned it in your piece about sustainable agriculture.

Emma stares at the coffee, then at Marcus.

**EMMA**  
You read my work. How flattering. Though I'm wondering if that's because you're vetting threats or genuinely care about crop rotation.

**MARCUS**  
*(slight smile, leaning back)*  
I read everything that matters. Your work on financial predators was particularly insightful—the way you connected personal stories to systemic failures. It reminded me why journalism matters when it's done right.

**EMMA**  
When it's done right. Meaning when it doesn't interfere with your business interests? Tyler thought he was doing it right too, and now he's dead. So forgive me if I'm not charmed by your book club commentary.

Marcus's expression shifts to genuine concern.

**MARCUS**  
*(voice softening, paternal)*  
Tyler's death was a tragedy, Emma. But it wasn't murder—it was a desperate man making a desperate choice. Elizabeth fed him paranoid theories, made him believe enemies were everywhere. That's what she does. She takes people's pain and twists it into weapons.

**CUT TO BLACK.**

**TITLE SEQUENCE**

### ACT ONE

**INT. VICTROLA COFFEE - CONTINUOUS**

Emma leans forward, studying Marcus's face.

**EMMA**  
And what do you do with people's pain, Marcus? Because sitting here, offering me coffee and compliments while my friend is in the morgue—this feels pretty twisted too.

**MARCUS**  
What I *do* with people's pain? I help them understand it. Channel it. Your father was drowning in guilt over your mother's accident—I simply showed him how to transform that into purpose.

Emma's cup stops halfway to her lips.

**EMMA**  
You knew my father?

**MARCUS**  
Richard Chen was brilliant. His financial analysis in '06 and '07 was remarkable—he saw patterns others missed. Unfortunately, he couldn't accept that some patterns exist for a reason.

**EMMA**  
What reason?

**MARCUS**  
The same reason we have traffic lights, Emma. Not because we want to control where people go, but because without guidance, they crash into each other.

Marcus pulls out a tablet, swipes to show a graph.

**MARCUS (CONT'D)**  
Your father identified families who would struggle with variable rate mortgages. We tried to redirect those loans, but he insisted on making his research public. That would have created panic, bank runs, economic collapse.

**EMMA**  
So you targeted those families anyway.

**MARCUS**  
We managed the crisis. Limited the damage. Your family was unfortunate collateral, but preventing wider economic catastrophe required difficult choices.

Emma stands abruptly.

**EMMA**  
Difficult choices. Right. I need some air.

**MARCUS**  
Emma, please. Sit down. Let me explain something to you.

There's steel in his voice now. Emma hesitates, recognizes the shift.

**MARCUS (CONT'D)**  
Everyone is a problem to be solved, Emma. The question is whether we solve them with intention and care, or let chaos decide for us. I've been protecting you from that chaos your entire life.

**EMMA**  
*(voice shaking with rage)*  
You've been *watching* me? Manipulating my entire life? Those job rejections, the relationships that mysteriously fell apart—that was *you*?

**MARCUS**  
*(remaining eerily calm)*  
I eliminated variables that would have caused you pain. Every person I removed from your path was a calculated decision for your wellbeing.

**EMMA**  
*(backing away)*  
You're insane. You took away my *choices*—my right to make mistakes, to grow, to *live*!

**MARCUS**  
Can't you see that without me, you would have destroyed yourself by now? That boyfriend in college—he was selling drugs to pay gambling debts. That job at the Times—your editor was an alcoholic sexual predator. I *saved* you from those mistakes.

Emma is at the door, other customers staring.

**EMMA**  
Stay away from me.

**MARCUS**  
*(calling after her)*  
Elizabeth will promise you truth, Emma, but her truth leads to war. Think about your family. Think about Tyler. How many more will die for her version of transparency?

Emma pushes through the door.

**EXT. VICTROLA COFFEE - CONTINUOUS**

Emma bursts onto the sidewalk, hyperventilating. She fumbles for her phone, then notices a man in a grey jacket watching her from across the street.

She walks quickly toward the parking garage, checking over her shoulder.

**INT. PARKING GARAGE - DAY**

Emma hurries to her car, keys shaking in her hand. Footsteps echo behind her.

**VOICE (O.S.)**  
Emma. Wait.

She spins around. JAMES HAWTHORNE (40) emerges from behind a concrete pillar—well-dressed, hands visible, non-threatening but alert.

**EMMA**  
Who are you?

**JAMES**  
James Hawthorne. I work with Marcus. Or... I'm supposed to.

**EMMA**  
Great. More surveillance.

**JAMES**  
Actually, I'm here to tell you something Marcus doesn't want you to know.

Emma studies his face, recognizes something genuine.

**EMMA**  
Why?

**JAMES**  
Because someone should.

**JAMES (CONT'D)**  
Marcus sent me to approach you after that meeting, while you were vulnerable. To offer protection, make you feel safe, gain your trust. Standard recruitment protocol.

**EMMA**  
And instead you're... telling me this?

**JAMES**  
Instead I'm telling you this.

James looks around the garage, checking for surveillance.

**JAMES (CONT'D)**  
My family has been part of this system for generations. Banking, finance, now tech—different methods, same control. I've executed these operations before, Emma. I know how this works.

**EMMA**  
So why help me?

**JAMES**  
Because what Marcus did to you in there—using your father's death, your family's pain—that's not protection. That's predation.

Emma leans against her car, processing.

**EMMA**  
This could destroy you with them.

**JAMES**  
Probably.

**EMMA**  
Your family, your career, everything.

**JAMES**  
*(meeting her eyes)*  
Yeah.

A long pause. Emma makes a decision.

**EMMA**  
I have historical documents. From the 1700s. Elizabeth gave them to me—they show this system has existed for centuries.

**JAMES**  
I've seen some of those documents. My family kept records.

**EMMA**  
Will you help me understand them?

**JAMES**  
If you'll help me figure out how to stop what we've become.

They shake hands. A partnership born of mutual courage.

---

### ACT TWO

**INT. EMMA'S APARTMENT - DAY**

Emma and James sit on the floor, historical documents spread between them alongside James's family papers. Banking records, genealogy charts, corporate structures.

**JAMES**  
The Hawthorne Bank was one of the founding institutions. We financed railroads, steel mills, shipping—always with the understanding that we were building American prosperity.

**EMMA**  
But really building control systems.

**JAMES**  
We told ourselves it was stewardship. That people needed guidance to make good decisions with money, with their lives.

Emma points to a document.

**EMMA**  
"Acceptable loss quotas." Your family kept statistics on how many people they were willing to sacrifice for economic stability.

**JAMES**  
*(quietly)*  
Ten to fifteen percent of any affected population. We called it "natural adjustment to market forces."

**EMMA**  
Jesus, James.

**JAMES**  
The 2008 crisis wasn't a failure, Emma. It was a success. A controlled demolition to eliminate financial independence in specific communities, create dependency, demonstrate consequences for economic resistance.

Emma stares at the banking records.

**EMMA**  
My family wasn't random.

**JAMES**  
Your father's analysis threatened the whole system. If people understood how deliberately the crash was engineered, if they saw the patterns he'd identified...

**EMMA**  
Revolution.

**JAMES**  
Or chaos. Marcus genuinely believes that transparency leads to collapse, that people can't handle the truth about how power actually works.

**EMMA**  
What do you believe?

**JAMES**  
I used to believe in necessary guidance. But watching Marcus manipulate you today, seeing how we've controlled your entire life without your knowledge or consent...

He meets her eyes.

**JAMES (CONT'D)**  
I think maybe people deserve the chance to make their own mistakes.

Emma's phone buzzes. Text message.

**EMMA**  
Elizabeth. She wants to meet tonight. Says she has more information about Marcus's operations, and about your family's role.

**JAMES**  
Emma... Elizabeth isn't necessarily who she claims to be either.

**EMMA**  
What do you mean?

**JAMES**  
The Circle—her organization—they're not just fighting for transparency. They want to replace our system with their own version of control.

**EMMA**  
How do you know?

**JAMES**  
Because Elizabeth and Marcus used to work together. In the early 2000s, they were both fighting the traditional banking families. But when they had to choose between gradual reform and radical transparency...

**EMMA**  
They split.

**JAMES**  
Violently. Marcus went toward guided protection, Elizabeth toward forced revelation. Both think they know what's best for humanity.

Emma stares at the documents.

**EMMA**  
So who do I trust?

**JAMES**  
Maybe... nobody completely. Maybe that's the point.

### ACT THREE

**INT. NEW ORDER OFFICES - NIGHT**

Sleek, modern, screens everywhere showing data streams. Marcus walks through the space, phone to his ear.

**MARCUS**  
*(into phone)*  
She rejected the reasonable approach... No, James was supposed to recruit her afterward... What do you mean he warned her?

Marcus stops at a wall of monitors showing surveillance feeds.

**MARCUS (CONT'D)**  
Find them. Both of them. And activate the Emma Chen contingency protocols.

**ASSISTANT (O.S.)**  
Sir, that will expose our surveillance capabilities.

**MARCUS**  
She's already exposed. Better to demonstrate consequences than allow resistance to spread.

**INT. EMMA'S APARTMENT - SAME TIME**

Emma and James continue reviewing documents. Her laptop is open, research windows covering the screen.

**EMMA**  
I've been thinking about what you said. About not trusting anyone completely.

**JAMES**  
Yeah?

**EMMA**  
What if the real problem isn't choosing between Marcus's control and Elizabeth's transparency? What if it's that both approaches assume people can't govern themselves?

**JAMES**  
Meaning?

**EMMA**  
Maybe the solution isn't better leaders. Maybe it's no leaders.

James considers this.

**JAMES**  
That sounds like chaos.

**EMMA**  
Or freedom.

Emma closes her laptop, decision made.

**EMMA (CONT'D)**  
I'm going to meet Elizabeth tonight. But I'm not joining her organization. I'm going to get information, verify what we can, and then decide how to proceed independently.

**JAMES**  
"We"?

**EMMA**  
You said you wanted to figure out how to stop what your family became. This is how. We investigate, we document, we expose—but we don't replace one control system with another.

**JAMES**  
That's dangerous. For both of us.

**EMMA**  
*(standing)*  
Then I guess we better be careful.

James stands, extends his hand.

**JAMES**  
Partners?

**EMMA**  
Partners.

They shake hands again, but this time it feels different. More intimate. The beginning of something beyond professional alliance.

**EMMA (CONT'D)**  
James?

**JAMES**  
Yeah?

**EMMA**  
Thank you. For choosing honesty over orders.

**JAMES**  
Thank you for giving me a reason to.

Emma's phone buzzes. Another text from Elizabeth.

**EMMA**  
*(reading)*  
"Bring the documents. There's something about the Guardians you need to know."

**JAMES**  
The Guardians?

**EMMA**  
David—my editor—mentioned them. Elizabeth thinks they're the real power behind both the New Order and the Circle.

**JAMES**  
Then we're walking into something bigger than we thought.

**EMMA**  
Story of my life this week.

She gathers the documents, checks her keys.

**EMMA (CONT'D)**  
Ready to meet with a maybe-ally to discuss a maybe-conspiracy that might control maybe-everything?

**JAMES**  
*(slight smile)*  
When you put it like that, how can I resist?

They head toward the door together. Outside, surveillance cameras track their movement.

**FADE TO BLACK.**
