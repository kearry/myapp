## ORIGINAL ILLUMINATI CODEX (1776)

### FOUNDING DOCUMENT EXCERPT
*From the Bavarian State Archives - Adam Weishaupt's Original Charter*

**"Ordo Illuminati - The True Playbook for Social Order"**

*Translated from Original German*

#### CORE PRINCIPLES

**Article I: On the Nature of Control**
"True power lies not in force, but in the shaping of belief. He who controls what men think possible, controls what they will attempt. He who controls what they think moral, controls what they will resist."

**Article II: On the Evolution of Methods**
"As mankind advances, so must our methods advance. What worked through religious authority will work through financial necessity. What works through financial necessity will work through information dependency."

**Article III: On Institutional Infiltration**
"Place our brothers in positions of influence within existing structures. Better to guide the existing order than to replace it with obvious revolution. The hand that guides must remain invisible."

**Article IV: On Economic Manipulation**
"Control of currency is control of commerce. Control of commerce is control of sustenance. Control of sustenance is control of obedience. Let men believe they are free while we guide their choices."

**Article V: On Information Management**
"In time, knowledge itself will become the primary currency. He who controls the flow of information controls the perception of reality. Truth becomes what serves order."
