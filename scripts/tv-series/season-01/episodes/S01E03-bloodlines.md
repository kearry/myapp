## SCRIPT

### TEASER

**FADE IN:**

**EXT. HAWTHORNE ESTATE - NIGHT**

Sprawling Victorian mansion against stormy sky. Security lights illuminate manicured grounds. Emma's car approaches the circular drive.

**TITLE CARD: "HAWTHORNE ESTATE - 11:47 PM"**

**INT. EMMA'S CAR - CONTINUOUS**

Emma checks her rearview mirror, nervous energy. Documents from Elizabeth scattered on passenger seat.

**EMMA**  
*(to herself)*  
Three hundred years of banking history. This better be worth it.

James emerges from the mansion, waves her toward the side entrance.

**INT. HAWTHORNE ESTATE - KITCHEN - NIGHT**

Massive commercial kitchen, modern appliances in period setting. James leads Emma through, checking over his shoulder.

**JAMES**  
Staff's gone for the night. Security system's on minimal—just perimeter.

**EMMA**  
James, what aren't you telling me?

**JAMES**  
*(stopping)*  
What do you mean?

**EMMA**  
Yesterday you were following Marcus's orders. Today you're risking everything to help me. People don't change that fast without a reason.

**JAMES**  
*(meeting her eyes)*  
Maybe they do when they see what they've really been part of.

He leads her to a bookshelf, presses a hidden panel. The shelf swings open, revealing an elevator.

**EMMA**  
*(staring)*  
You've got to be kidding me.

**JAMES**  
My great-great-grandfather was paranoid about bank runs. Had this built during the 1890s panic.

**CUT TO BLACK.**

**TITLE SEQUENCE**

### ACT ONE

**INT. HAWTHORNE VAULT - NIGHT**

Elevator opens into climate-controlled archive. Rows of filing cabinets, safe deposit boxes, historical documents under protective glass.

**EMMA**  
*(impressed despite herself)*  
This is incredible.

**JAMES**  
Three centuries of Hawthorne banking. Every loan, every investment, every... decision.

Emma examines documents under glass—handwritten ledgers, family photographs, corporate charters.

**EMMA**  
These show your family's involvement since the beginning. But Marcus said you were just discovering the conspiracy.

**JAMES**  
Because I was. These *(gestures to historical documents)* I knew about. Family history, museum pieces. But this...

He leads her to a modern filing cabinet, unlocks it with a keycard.

**JAMES (CONT'D)**  
This I found yesterday.

He opens a file labeled "ACTIVE OPERATIONS 2025."

**EMMA**  
*(reading)*  
"Rothschild derivatives eliminated last month, Warburg real estate seized yesterday..." James, these aren't historical records.

**JAMES**  
Current operations. Updated three days ago.

Emma flips through pages, her expression changing from curiosity to horror.

**EMMA**  
Eight families left. The Morgensterns, Vanderbilts, Astors... James, there's a timeline. They're all scheduled to die in the next two weeks.

**JAMES**  
*(pointing to methodology section)*  
Using your father's research. The same financial stress patterns he identified in 2008.

**EMMA**  
*(voice breaking)*  
They turned his work into a murder manual.

**JAMES**  
Emma, there's something else. Page twelve.

She turns to the page, reads silently. Her face goes pale.

**EMMA**  
I'm not just investigating this. I'm... bait?

**JAMES**  
Marcus has been positioning you to witness the eliminations. You investigate the Morgenstern family finances, they're killed, you become the perfect witness to testify it was natural market forces.

**EMMA**  
And I'd believe it because I discovered the evidence myself.

**JAMES**  
According to this, the Hawthorne family elimination is scheduled for next week. I'm supposed to die too, Emma. We're both expendable.

Silence. Emma processes the scope of manipulation.

**EMMA**  
You're really willing to die to stop this?

**JAMES**  
I'm willing to die to give you the choice I never had. To let you decide what to do with the truth instead of having someone else decide for you.

Suddenly, red lights flash throughout the vault. A computerized voice echoes:

**COMPUTER VOICE**  
Perimeter breach. Unauthorized personnel detected.

James checks his phone, sees multiple missed calls from "Uncle William."

**JAMES**  
*(grim)*  
We need to go. Now.

**EMMA**  
The documents—

**JAMES**  
Take pictures. Everything you can.

Emma frantically photographs pages while James checks security feeds on a tablet.

**JAMES (CONT'D)**  
Three vehicles. Professional formation. They're already at the house.

**EMMA**  
Marcus?

**JAMES**  
Or worse.

Heavy footsteps echo from above. James grabs a waterproof document bag, starts stuffing Emma's photos and key files inside.

**JAMES (CONT'D)**  
Emergency exit. Through the wine cellar.

They head for a second elevator as footsteps grow louder.

---

### ACT TWO

**INT. HAWTHORNE ESTATE - MAIN HALL - SAME TIME**

WILLIAM HAWTHORNE (65) enters with two estate security guards, flashlights cutting through darkness. Authoritative, patrician, deeply concerned.

**WILLIAM**  
Check the study first. Then the family archive.

The guards split up. William's phone rings.

**WILLIAM (CONT'D)**  
*(answering)*  
Marcus? Yes, I know about the breach... What do you mean kill team?

**INT. WINE CELLAR - CONTINUOUS**

James and Emma emerge from hidden elevator into extensive wine collection. Bottles from floor to ceiling, narrow passages between racks.

**EMMA**  
*(whispering)*  
How do we get out?

**JAMES**  
*(pointing)*  
Service tunnel. Leads to the carriage house.

They move carefully through wine racks. Emma clutches the document bag.

**EMMA**  
James, if we don't make it—

**JAMES**  
We'll make it.

**EMMA**  
If we don't, these documents need to reach someone who can use them.

**JAMES**  
*(stopping)*  
Emma, there's something I need to tell you.

Footsteps above, growing closer.

**JAMES (CONT'D)**  
My family... we've done terrible things. For centuries. I can't undo that, but I can stop it from continuing.

**EMMA**  
James—

**VOICE (O.S.)**  
*(echoing through cellar)*  
James. I know you're down here.

They freeze. William's voice.

**WILLIAM (O.S.)**  
Come out. Let's discuss this like family.

James considers for a moment, then makes a decision.

**JAMES**  
*(to Emma, quietly)*  
Stay here. He won't hurt me.

**EMMA**  
James, don't—

But he's already walking toward the main cellar area.

**INT. WINE CELLAR - MAIN AREA - CONTINUOUS**

William stands with a flashlight, alone. No guards visible.

**WILLIAM**  
James.

**JAMES**  
Uncle William.

**WILLIAM**  
You've accessed files that could destroy our family. Everything we've built over three centuries.

**JAMES**  
Everything we've built on other people's suffering.

**WILLIAM**  
You think this is about cruelty? About power for its own sake?

William approaches, voice pained but resolute.

**WILLIAM (CONT'D)**  
Every family we've "eliminated," every life lost—it's prevented larger conflicts. Economic collapses that would have killed millions.

**JAMES**  
That's what Marcus tells you. What he tells himself.

**WILLIAM**  
James, Marcus called me personally. He knows what you've done. The kill team is already deployed.

**JAMES**  
*(shocked)*  
What?

**WILLIAM**  
Twenty minutes. Maybe less. If you come with me now, if you help us contain this, Marcus might show mercy.

Emma emerges from the shadows, document bag in hand.

**EMMA**  
Mr. Hawthorne, I'm Emma Chen. Your nephew is risking everything to expose systematic murder.

**WILLIAM**  
*(to Emma, almost gently)*  
Miss Chen, you don't understand. There is no "other way" with Marcus Rhodes. You're either useful to him, or you're a problem to be solved.

**JAMES**  
Then we solve ourselves.

**WILLIAM**  
*(desperate)*  
James, please. I raised you after your parents died. Don't make me choose between you and the survival of everyone else in this family.

**JAMES**  
I'm not making you choose, Uncle William. I'm making my choice. And I choose to stop being part of a system that murders families for asking questions.

Long silence. William's shoulders sag with profound sadness.

**WILLIAM**  
*(to security via radio)*  
Stand down. Let them go.

**SECURITY VOICE**  
Sir, Marcus's orders were clear—

**WILLIAM**  
*(sharp authority)*  
I said stand down.

**WILLIAM**  
*(to James)*  
Southeast exit. Leads to the old mill road.

**JAMES**  
Uncle William—

**WILLIAM**  
*(voice breaking)*  
I'm proud of you, James. Even if it kills us all.

### ACT THREE

**EXT. HAWTHORNE ESTATE - SOUTHEAST EXIT - NIGHT**

James and Emma emerge from hidden exit near estate boundary. Emma's car visible across open ground.

**JAMES**  
Fifty yards. Stay low.

They run in a crouch. Halfway to the car, tactical lights sweep the grounds. Black SUVs approaching the main house.

**EMMA**  
*(breathing hard)*  
They're early.

**JAMES**  
Move!

They sprint the remaining distance. Emma starts the car as tactical lights turn toward them.

**INT. EMMA'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT**

Emma drives while James navigates using childhood knowledge of estate roads.

**JAMES**  
Left here. This connects to the mill road.

**EMMA**  
James, your uncle—

**JAMES**  
He made his choice. I made mine.

In the rearview mirror, two SUVs emerge from estate grounds, headlights cutting through rain.

**JAMES (CONT'D)**  
They're following. Take the bridge—it's narrow, they can't maneuver there.

**EXT. MILL ROAD - STONE BRIDGE - NIGHT**

Emma's car crosses single-lane stone bridge over creek. The SUVs are forced to follow single-file.

**INT. EMMA'S CAR - CONTINUOUS**

**EMMA**  
What's after the bridge?

**JAMES**  
Forest road. They don't know it's there.

**EMMA**  
And if they do?

**JAMES**  
Then we run.

The car hits rough terrain. Engine starts making grinding noises.

**JAMES (CONT'D)**  
Emma, the car—

**EMMA**  
I know, I know.

The engine dies. They coast to a stop in dense forest.

**EXT. FOREST ROAD - NIGHT**

Emma and James grab the document bag and flee into the woods as SUV headlights approach.

**EXT. FOREST - NIGHT**

They move through dense undergrowth, document bag clutched between them. Behind them, tactical lights sweep methodically.

**JAMES**  
*(whispering)*  
Creek bed. Thermal imaging can't track us in the water.

They splash down into shallow creek, moving carefully upstream.

**EXT. FOREST - CREEK BED - NIGHT**

Cold water, careful movement, constant awareness of pursuit. Emma slips, James catches her.

**EMMA**  
*(quietly)*  
The documents—

**JAMES**  
They're waterproof. Keep moving.

They reach a small cliff where the creek drops over rocks.

**JAMES (CONT'D)**  
We have to climb down. It's the only way they won't expect.

**EMMA**  
In the dark?

**JAMES**  
In the dark.

They carefully descend the rocky cliff, document bag secured between them.

**EXT. FOREST - BELOW CLIFF - NIGHT**

They reach the bottom, exhausted but alive. Tactical lights visible above, but not following.

**JAMES**  
Old mill manager's office. We can rest there.

**INT. ABANDONED MILL OFFICE - NIGHT**

Small office with dusty furniture, broken windows. James secures the perimeter while Emma opens the document bag.

**EMMA**  
*(checking documents)*  
Everything's here. We did it.

**JAMES**  
*(sitting heavily)*  
We survived. That's different than succeeding.

Emma starts uploading photos to encrypted cloud storage on her phone.

**EMMA**  
Eight families, James. According to this timeline, the Morgenstern family is scheduled for elimination tomorrow night.

**JAMES**  
You want to warn them.

**EMMA**  
I want to save them.

**JAMES**  
And then what? Warn the next family? And the next?

**EMMA**  
If that's what it takes.

Emma's phone buzzes. Text from Elizabeth.

**EMMA (CONT'D)**  
*(reading)*  
Elizabeth. She says she's been monitoring New Order communications. She knows what happened tonight.

**JAMES**  
What does she want?

**EMMA**  
To help us contact the remaining families safely. She has secure communication networks.

**JAMES**  
Emma, Elizabeth has her own agenda.

**EMMA**  
Right now, she's the only person offering to help.

James looks at Emma in the dim light filtering through broken windows.

**JAMES**  
What are we doing here, Emma? Really?

**EMMA**  
We're stopping systematic murder.

**JAMES**  
And after that?

**EMMA**  
*(meeting his eyes)*  
I don't know. But I know we're doing it together.

They share a moment of quiet understanding. Partners forged through fire.

**EMMA (CONT'D)**  
James?

**JAMES**  
Yeah?

**EMMA**  
Thank you. For choosing truth over safety.

**JAMES**  
Thank you for giving me something worth choosing.

Emma's phone buzzes again. Another text from Elizabeth.

**EMMA**  
*(reading)*  
"Marcus is accelerating the timeline. Morgenstern family moved to tonight. If you want to save them, we need to move now."

James and Emma look at each other. The choice is clear.

**JAMES**  
Then we move.

They gather the documents, prepare to leave their temporary sanctuary.

**FADE TO BLACK.**
